Google prediction api is an ongoing project that sets up a handshake with Google Prediction API, returns
training model status, and quickly calls the API training methods for exploratory black box analysis on 
submitted datasets. 

Currently the returned queries from the training methods can be brought back into Spyder's variable explorer 
for exploratory analysis and serves as the infastructure to better train some of the black box methods for greater accuracy, 
while retaining the speed and convenience of machine learning on Google's cloud.
